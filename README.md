# -D3-Challenge
I was able to get multiple options for each axis although the Y axis labels move around and I am not sure why. I am aware that I was supposed to tie the tool tip to the circles but I feel that it blocked the circles underneath it and it seemed more usable presenting the tooltip in the top left of the chrome.
